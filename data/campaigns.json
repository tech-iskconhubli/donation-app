    "details": "Dev Shayani Ekadashi, also known as Ashadhi Ekadashi or Hari Shayani Ekadashi, marks the onset of Lord Vishnu’s cosmic slumber for four months—known as Chaturmas. Falling on the 11th lunar day of the bright fortnight in Ashadha month (June–July), this Ekadashi holds immense significance in Vaishnava tradition.\n\nIt is believed that on this day, Lord Vishnu retires to rest in the Ksheer Sagar (Ocean of Milk) on Sheshnag, marking a spiritual pause in cosmic activities until Prabodhini Ekadashi. During this sacred time, devotees commit to acts of devotion, fasting, and charity to seek divine blessings and accumulate spiritual merit.",
